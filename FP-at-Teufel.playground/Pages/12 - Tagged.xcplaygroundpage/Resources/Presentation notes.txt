Tagged: A User ID that is a String, and an Invoice that is a String, could be mistakenly swapped. Use Tagged versions of those to avoid this problem:

```
struct User {
    let id: Tagged<User, String>
    let name: String
}

struct Invoice {
    let id: Tagged<Invoice, String>
    let date: Date
}

func getInvoice(id: Tagged<Invoice, String>) -> Invoice? {
     // ...
}
```
