Functional Reactive Programming is becoming more popular and now even Apple is investing and recommending that.
Watching WWDC 2019 makes this very obvious and Combine is a powerful tool that, sooner or later will be fully integrated
to Core Foundation and to the main platform frameworks, replacing delegates, KVOs, callbacks, notifications as the
main pub/sub pattern.

We already spoke a lot about data structures, so at this point it should be clear the reasons we need to invest on FRP:
- To represent stream of events as values
- Making it composable, testable, separation of declaration and execution, state consistency
- Everything is a stream of events (user interactions, external actors, callbacks)

How?
- RxSwift, ReactiveSwift or Combine, learn one and you'll learn all.
