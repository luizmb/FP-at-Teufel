 ### Focus on Data Structures

 - Optional (sync disjunction)
 - Result type (sync disjunction)
 - Promises (async disjunction)
 - Array (sync continuous disjunction)
 - Event Streams / Reactive (async continuous disjunction)
 - Effect (similar to Event Stream, general case for any side-effect)
 - Reader (dependency injection)
 - Writer (side-effects)
 - State (mutation)

 and their operators:
 - map / contramap / bimap / dimap
 - flatMap
 - zip
 - traverse
 - fold / analysis
 - lift
